# Monitoring Project README

## Overview

This project aims to set up a monitoring infrastructure for a multi-machine environment using various tools and services. The infrastructure consists of five machines with different configurations, each serving specific purposes. The monitoring setup includes the utilization of Wazuh, Splunk, Uptime Robot, New Relic, and PagerDuty for comprehensive monitoring and incident management.

   - Private IP Address: 172.31.0.111 
   - Purpose: Being monitored by Wazuh.

## Monitoring Tools and Services

- **Uptime Robot:**
  - Purpose: Monitoring the availability of all machines and services.
  
- **New Relic:**
  - Purpose: Comprehensive monitoring of all machines to gather performance metrics and insights.

- **Wazuh:**
  - Purpose: Intrusion detection and monitoring solution, integrated with various machines and services for real-time threat detection.

- **Splunk:**
  - Purpose: Log management and analysis tool, used to monitor the machines and analyze logs for security and performance issues.

- **PagerDuty:**
  - Purpose: Incident management and alerting platform, integrated with Wazuh to receive and manage alerts triggered by security events.

## Usage

1. **Setting up Machines:**
   - Follow the provided configurations for each machine to set up the environment accordingly.

2. **Installing Monitoring Tools:**
   - Install and configure Wazuh, Splunk, and any necessary agents on respective machines as per the provided documentation.

3. **Integrating Services:**
